# Week 2

## Yago
I implemented a service backed by Firebase Storage to act as the low-level layer of our database (#45). Furthermore, I prepared the high-level layer that matches our current database’s interface (#49).

I also created a small writeup with good committing practices (#40), and reviewed #15, #38, #41 and #48.

This week I am quite happy with my overall performance, but in the future I will try to be more generous with the time assigned for tests, and try to allocate time for chores/documentation at the sprint planning whenever I consider it necessary.
## Leandro
I created the view for the list selection activity. It is very simple for now, but it will evolve in the future. Then, I implemented the controller for the list selection activity. Although the controller itself is done, I couldn’t publish it since I didn’t know how to test it. My organization was better this week, I could work more than the past one. However, I spent some time struggling with Git, but I have a better comprehension now. Next week I will try to spend more time on testing and on reviewing.
## Noah
## Théo
I re-organized the database interface so we will not need one adapter per Object in our app.
I also re-defined some methods for the tasks and created the logic for the to-do list.
Then, I integrated what I have done in the work of Vincent and Noah, in the ItemViewActivity.

I am happy about how I worked this week. My tasks were much more precise than the previous sprint,
and so it was easier to see where I was going.
I tried and, I will keep going, to improve my reviews.
## Vincent
I fixed an issue with the layout in order to create a task. I advanced the controller for the todoList view, and reviewed a few PRs.

I am all in all happy with the quality of the work I did, however I had a few issues communicating which hindered me a bit to get more work done.

## Sydney
This week I addressed issues #30, #31, #28 and #17. These were all related to authentication capabilities of the app. I decided to address them altogether in one PR.
Working on it has made me realise how much additional work there will be needed on that part. I will potentially address some of the issues related to authentication and user profile management in the next sprint.

On a personal note, I notice that I work on the sprint tasks way too late before the next sprint weekly. I think I need to lower my workload outside of SDP. At the moment I work a job at 50 % and work on courses worth 22 credits. I will decide soon to drop one or two courses this semester in order to have a more reasonable workload for the rest of the semester.

## Overall team
Globally the tasks are becoming more clear. We are improving our workflow, coordination, communication and gradually reaching the cruise speed. 
However there is a need for tweaks : for example we agree that some issues might be addressed a little too late during the sprint.
By continuing like this I am sure we will keep improving and learning.
